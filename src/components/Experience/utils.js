    description: `At Keyo AI, I helped with the development of a new payment processing flow for over 400 tenants to pay rent on the mobile application.
    I developed the new mobile UI design and helped with developing new backend functions for this feature. New backend functions were fully tested via 
    Mocha and Chai and were used to serve new API endpoints to fetch and modify data from our database.
    Other features included adding web UI on our admin dashboard for landlords to edit and add invoices and payments to a lease.`,

    companyName: 'Genentech',
    duration: 'May 2018 - January 2019',
    description: `At Genentech, I developed a web dashboard containg data automation and data analysis tools.
    I helped with developing the web UI and creating a Node.js API server to fetch and modify data from our database.
    For my team, data was still being stored in Excel/PowerPoint files across multiple devices.
    Data was scattered and we wanted to find a solution that will centralize our data and automate long manual processes. 
    With the web dashboard, scientists can input data into our database and visualize that data via graphs and reports.
    One of the tools created is a report generation tool that aggregates data for an experiment and downloads it into a .docx file.
    The whole process takes less than ten seconds, whereas it would take a scientist up to two hours of manual work to create!`,

    duration: 'June 2017 - August 2017',
    description: `At Peek, I was mostly doing onboarding work. When a new customer signs up with our software,
    I would be the one that would interact with them and guide them on how to use our software.
    However, I was able to work on a software project that consisted of writing two Python scripts that scraped tourist activity data off the web.
    The scripts would scrape the data and write it to an Excel file.
    The file would be used by our Sales team to see if there could be any customers that could benefit from using our software.
    With this script, we were able to generate over 300 new lead opportunities for potential customers for our Sales team!`,

    description: `At Achievable, I helped with the development of an admin dashboard.
    This dashboard would be used by teachers and admins to view student's progress and manage enrollment.
    I also helped with integrating Storybook into our codebase. Storybook allows developers to view and interact with UI outside of the main application.
    This allows for isolated development and testing of our UI library, improving development speed!`,
